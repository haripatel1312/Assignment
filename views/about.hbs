          <p class="lead">Hello! I'm <strong class="text-highlight">Hari Patel</strong>, a passionate learner and tech enthusiast specializing in Information Technology and Computer Programming.</p>
          <p>
            I began my academic journey by completing my Secondary School Certificate (SSC) in 2019, during which I developed a deep interest in technology. This fascination drove me to pursue a Diploma in Information Technology, which I successfully completed in 2022 with distinction.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2023, I took a bold step by moving to Canada to further my education and career. Currently, I am exploring new opportunities in the dynamic field of computer programming, enhancing my skills, and building on my foundation of knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have been involved in various projects that have strengthened my problem-solving abilities, collaborative skills, and technical expertise. Whether itâ€™s coding complex applications, working with new frameworks, or learning cutting-edge technologies, I am always eager to take on new challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            My ultimate goal is to become a versatile software developer who can contribute to innovative solutions and make an impact in the technology industry. I'm continuously learning and evolving, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead.
